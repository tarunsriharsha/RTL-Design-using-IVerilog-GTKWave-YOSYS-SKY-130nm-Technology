# RTL-Design-using-IVerilog-GTKWave-YOSYS-SKY-130nm-Technology
A 5 day workshop to design Register Transfer Logic for computing processors using EDA Tools

### Introduction to the AIM of workshop :
Computing needs realizable processing of different areas of target to achieve what it intends unlike random linear processing.

Hence the need for Logic to mend different process to achieve targeted result.

Digital Processing using Binary Voltage Levels replaced Mechanical Processing which used relays and switches.

In order to store the voltage level we need a platform to get hold on and this is called REGISTER.

REGISTERS comprised of Transistor are used to achieve this Binary Logic Levels which is 1(+5 volt) and 0(O volt) i.e., the difference in voltage levels is made to perceive as Binary Logic.

REGISTER needs to change its holding voltage levels to achieve different states of Logic.

REGISTERS Transferring Voltage Levels gives rise to REGISTER TRANSFERRABLE LOGIC shortly defined RTL.

RTL gives rise to Logic
